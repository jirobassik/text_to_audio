# Text to voice app
An intelligent system for voicing texts allows the user to enter their own text for voicing, as well as selecting a specific voice with which the text will be voiced. 
After performing the voice acting, the resulting result can be downloaded in wav format.
### Listed below is all the functionality that the system can produce:
- registration, login and password reset;
- entering text for voiceover;
- adding your own audio files that will be useful in voice acting;
- viewing a collection of voices;
- selecting a replacement voice from the collection;
- downloading the voiced text in wav format;
- view history, which can be used for full-text and natural language searches;
- tracking the result of processing work.
